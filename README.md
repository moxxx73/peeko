## Note on development

As of now only MacOS is supported (the code has not been tested on FreeBSD but may still work).  
A complete overhaul has been done on the project as the previous version was rushed near the 
end of development of a working "beta".

The new version of this project has been broken down, properly, into high level functionality to
low level functionality. As in the previous project this was somewhat present but when development
became rushed this design quickly disappeared.

Proper managment of memory and tasks has also been taken into consideration just as before with these
two objectives being of main concern.

Why am i doing this? because im so insecure about being labelled a script kiddy that i have to do
everything myself.
